This project is adapted from a program called "Hands on Banking". A GoogleSheet worksheet was created that contains two sheets.
One sheet has data for careers. Another sheet has a budget ledger where students can input expenses. The second sheet also
has a mock W-2. The numbers on the budget ledger and W-2 are populated with the data that is available on the first sheet.
The students are required to select the career they want to look at then fill in the ledger with the expenses they have.
The GoogleSheet is distributed using Schoology's Google Drive Assignment feature and each student gets their own copy.
